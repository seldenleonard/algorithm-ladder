# INSTRUCTIONS
# Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns a new array that contains all numbers from the original array that are less than 100.
  # Input: [99, 101, 88, 4, 2000, 50]
  # Output: [99, 88, 4, 50]

# Clarify
  # Input: [99, 101, 88, 4, 2000, 50]
  # Output: [99, 88, 4, 50]
# Visualize
  # For each value in the array, determine if it IS or IS NOT below 100
  # If a given value IS less than 100, add it to the array that will be output
  # Variables that must be defined: index, array of integers less than 100
# Write the Code
# Debugger
# Refactor
